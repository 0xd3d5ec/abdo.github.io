# Wazuh SIEM


## Background story first
Hello thereðŸ‘‹, welcome again to one of my blogs. This time we are going to talk about Wazuh SIEM. Here is a bit of a background as to what it is. 

Wazuh SIEM or as more professionally called a Security Identity and Event Management platform / system that aggregates and collects all logs from different sources across the organization's network and and various assets to consolidate it into a single central dashboard for easy management and monitoring along with easier remedeation and faster repsonse times to alerts and attacks. It is a very well known SIEM platform among other solutions in the infosec industry.

## The inner works of Wazuh
So to learn more I am going to explain it's main features and were it shines compared to the others in the industry. Also, where it may fall short and might be improved.

Wazuh works by installing agents on different operating systems with very small footprint. Those agents are configured during installation to connect back to a central component of the Wazuh platform called **Wazuh Manager** this is a very high level overview of how it basically works.

There are three different main components that are required to be present in order for the Wazuh SIEM to function as intended to alert and protect your environment.
- Wazuh Server
- Wazuh Dashboard
- Wazuh Indexer

### Wazuh Indexer, What is it?
The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. A Wazuh core component that indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities.

### Wazuh Dashboard, What the wolf sees...
The Wazuh dashboard is where you will see all the alerts and notifications about your environment. You will get to interact with what matters if any asset is missing compliance or vulnerable to some critical CVE. You will have a bird-eye view super powerðŸ¦….

As you can see from the above image of the Wazuh Dashboard you might have noticed the PCI DSS word up there, yes you are not dreamingðŸ¤¯. One of the main features of Wazuh SIEM is the ability to monitor compliance of your environment to different frameworks such as NIST one of the most popular main cybersecurity frameworks and PCI-DSS for the payment card industry. Making it easy to monitor stay compliant and effective at minimizing efforts of your cyber force.
