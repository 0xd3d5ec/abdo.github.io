This time we are going to talk about Wazuh SIEM. Here is a bit of a background as to what it is. Wazuh SIEM or as more professionally called a Security Identity and Event Management platform / system that aggregates and collects all logs from different sources across the organization‚Äôs network and and various assets to consolidate it into a single central dashboard for easy management and monitoring along with easier remedeation and faster repsonse times to alerts and attacks. It is a very well known SIEM platform among other solutions in the infosec industry.

Also, where it may fall short and might be improved. Wazuh works by installing agents on different operating systems with very small footprint. Those agents are configured during installation to connect back to a central component of the Wazuh platform called Wazuh Manager this is a very high level overview of how it basically works. There are three different main components that are required to be present in order for the Wazuh SIEM to function as intended to alert and protect your environment.

You will get to interact with what matters if any asset is missing compliance or vulnerable to some critical CVE. You will have a bird-eye view super powerü¶Ö. Wazuh Dashboard\rPCI-DSS Monitoring As you can see from the above image of the Wazuh Dashboard you might have noticed the PCI DSS word up there, yes you are not dreamingü§Ø. One of the main features of Wazuh SIEM is the ability to monitor compliance for your environment mapping to different frameworks such as NIST one of the most popular main cybersecurity frameworks and PCI-DSS for the payment card industry. Making it easy to monitor and stay compliant and effective at minimizing efforts of your cyber force. Vulnerability Detection Another neat feature of Wazuh SIEM is the vulnerability detection module. This module handles the auto detection of vulnerabilities from a locally fetched database image of the NVD (National Vulnerability Database). You can of course set the update interval and the date range vulnerabilities to fetch. The module detects operating system vulnerabilities and it‚Äôs currently installed applications on it. Wazuh Vuln Dashboard\rYou can move forward and invesitigate all the agents with Critical and high vulnerabilities to limit your exposure to cyber attacks. This will highly reduce the attack surface specially because it scans all installed applications on the systems the agent is installed on. File Integrity Monitoring Another specially neat feature is the full system monitoring feature which monitors all specified important and critical directories and files for any modifications. Any slight change or moditication to the system file or other files or directories you specify for it monitor will be monitored by generating a hash of it. One of the main pillars of cyber security triad CIA is integrity which can be achieved by monitoring any changes to the file system by using hashing algorithms were applicable. Here in our case hashing is used to monitor each and every file for modifications, as any slight change will change the hash completely. Wazuh FIM Module\rIntegrations There are many other features to talk about but I will not be covering them all as this will be quite the extensive blog. But another good thing that wazuh possess is the ability to integrate with other well known security vendors for enhanced work flow or abilities using powerfull APIs. Some of these integrations are Virustotal, Slack, PagerDuty, Shuffle, or you can make your own custom integration if you can program the API to do soüòâ. If you do a little search about all the previously mentioned API integrations you will notice something, and that is all of these integrations will help automate and create a full network of sorts for the cyber team to be more and well integrated to automatically notice and respond to alerts generated by the wazuh SIEM streamlining the process.

However, this open-source SIEM solution is very convenient for companies that don‚Äôt want to dish out a ton of budget or are limited with funds contraint when implementing a SIEM solution to protect their environment, this doesn‚Äôt subtract from it‚Äôs outstanding performance and feature set. If you need a wolf to watch over your environment for cyber and malicious network packets or file modifications you don‚Äôt have to think hard this is good, give it a try for yourself.

This scholarship is formed and established by two well known entities, CyberTalents platform and TREND MICRO who‚Äôs specialized in cloud and cybersecurity solutions. The scholarship application consisted of two parts. First part was to fill a general form asking about some personal information, experience, track you want to pursue. Second part is the tough one an assessment part made up of topics along with appropriately selected challenges to dive deep and solve. These challenges are in the form of CTF (Capture The Flag) style.

If you read the previous post about IELTS Academic exam you will know that I didn‚Äôt have the time to complete or even start the assessment part the application which consists of 29 challenges. The IELTS exam was on 29th a day before the end of registration for CT scholarship. These challenges tackle a wide range of cybersecurity topics from OSINT, web security, to reverse engineering and much more. Luckily, CT moderators decided to extend the scholarship time frame 15 days more until the 15th of May. This was like a god sent moment. Although I‚Äôm still working a full time job, I dedicated all my time out side of job hours to this part of the scholarship in hopes to get accepted.

To be honest, I haven‚Äôt really took a deep dive into RE until this moment so that was really tough. But some coffee and dedication can do wonders, lets not forget some YT videos lol. Finally, manages to solve the challenge and notified the CT team. When you spend lots of time doing something that challenges you, but never get tired, bored or quit and keep persevering towards your goals, thats when you know you have found your passion. Fast forward to 19th of May 2021, almost midnight after a crappy day got an email you have been accepted into the DFIR (Digital Forensics Incident Response) track also known with another name as blue teaming.
