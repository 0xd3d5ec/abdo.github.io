[{"categories":["siem","projects"],"content":"Background story first Hello there👋, welcome again to one of my blogs. This time we are going to talk about Wazuh SIEM. Here is a bit of a background as to what it is. Wazuh SIEM or as more professionally called a Security Identity and Event Management platform / system that aggregates and collects all logs from different sources across the organization’s network and and various assets to consolidate it into a single central dashboard for easy management and monitoring along with easier remedeation and faster repsonse times to alerts and attacks. It is a very well known SIEM platform among other solutions in the infosec industry.

Also, where it may fall short and might be improved. Wazuh works by installing agents on different operating systems with very small footprint. Those agents are configured during installation to connect back to a central component of the Wazuh platform called Wazuh Manager this is a very high level overview of how it basically works. There are three different main components that are required to be present in order for the Wazuh SIEM to function as intended to alert and protect your environment.

The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. A Wazuh core component that indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities.

You will get to interact with what matters if any asset is missing compliance or vulnerable to some critical CVE. You will have a bird-eye view super power🦅. Wazuh Dashboard\rAs you can see from the above image of the Wazuh Dashboard you might have noticed the PCI DSS word up there, yes you are not dreaming🤯. One of the main features of Wazuh SIEM is the ability to monitor compliance of your environment to different frameworks such as NIST one of the most popular main cybersecurity frameworks and PCI-DSS for the payment card industry. Making it easy to monitor stay compliant and effective at minimizing efforts of your cyber force.

I know a small program that suggests better passwords than what most people come up with like password😒, \u003cinsert username\u003e\u003csome year\u003e😒 or iloveyou😒 which are all very easy to guess and bruteforce. So I started grinding away as usual, let’s check the simple password generator below. ","date":"2023-10-09","objectID":"/passwordgen/:1:0","tags":["python","password gen"],"title":"Password Generator","uri":"/passwordgen/"},{"categories":["code","projects"],"content":"Program This is a password generator program written in python. Few libraries were used in this program to simplify the program and decrease written lines of code as much as possible. First of all we import the necessary libraries. Random to generate random ints, and string to populate the data lower, upper, digits and symbols. import random import string We then ask for the user input, initiating the program and determining the length of the password. print(\"hello, welcome to password generator!\") length = int(input(\"\\nEnter the length of the password:\")) Assign variables containing the letters, nums, and symbols from library. lower = string.ascii_lowercase upper = string.ascii_uppercase nm = string.digits symbols = string.punctuation Append all variables to one variable, in addition to that we randomize the generated string of password saving it to a temporary variable. Finally we move it from temp to a password variable to be printed. all = lower + upper + nm + symbols temp = random.sample(all, length) password = \"\".join(temp) print(password) ","date":"2023-10-09","objectID":"/passwordgen/:2:0","tags":["python","password gen"],"title":"Password Generator","uri":"/passwordgen/"},{"categories":["code","projects"],"content":"Moral of the story Hope this small program has peaked your interest to discover more and more importantly develop more complex passwords. At least next time you think about making a new account on some website remember to use something similar such a Password Manager or think of some hard password to guess😉. Until next time see ya👋.

This scholarship is formed and established by two well known entities, CyberTalents platform and TREND MICRO who’s specialized in cloud and cybersecurity solutions. The scholarship application consisted of two parts. First part was to fill a general form asking about some personal information, experience, track you want to pursue. Second part is the tough one an assessment part made up of topics along with appropriately selected challenges to dive deep and solve. These challenges are in the form of CTF (Capture The Flag) style.

If you read the previous post about IELTS Academic exam you will know that I didn’t have the time to complete or even start the assessment part the application which consists of 29 challenges. The IELTS exam was on 29th a day before the end of registration for CT scholarship. These challenges tackle a wide range of cybersecurity topics from OSINT, web security, to reverse engineering and much more. Luckily, CT moderators decided to extend the scholarship time frame 15 days more until the 15th of May. This was like a god sent moment. Although I’m still working a full time job, I dedicated all my time out side of job hours to this part of the scholarship in hopes to get accepted. I really felt like this scholarship will turn the tides of my life and career, because I will get to meet tons of like minded people and professionals in the field with years of experience.

I felt that I have to finish the rest of the remaining challenges first before giving my fully undivided attention to RE challenge. To be honest, I haven’t really took a deep dive into RE until this moment so that was really tough. But some coffee and dedication can do wonders, lets not forget some YT videos lol. Finally, manages to solve the challenge and notified the CT team. When you spend lots of time doing something that challenges you, but never get tired, bored or quit and keep persevering towards your goals, thats when you know you have found your passion. Fast forward to 19th of May 2021, almost midnight after a crappy day got an email you have been accepted into the DFIR (Digital Forensics Incident Response) track also known with another name as blue teaming. That moment couldn’t contain my excitement, as I was still shocked considering how small the pool of the scholarship when compared to applying individuals from different Arabic and African nations.
